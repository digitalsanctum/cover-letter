Dear Lacework,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Software Engineer** position at Lacework. With over 20 years of comprehensive experience in software engineering and distributed systems architecture, I believe I could bring a unique perspective and extensive technical proficiency to your team.

My career has allowed me to become highly proficient in a variety of languages including Java (15 years), Kotlin (5 years for server-side), Python, Ruby/JRuby, Rust (3 years), and JavaScript/TypeScript. 

I am well-versed in the development and design of APIs using the OpenAPI specification, and used AWS Kinesis, AWS SQS, Apache Kafka, NATS, and RabbitMQ for messaging systems. 

I have a deep understanding of cloud computing, having worked extensively with AWS. I have experience with serverless architectures like AWS Lambda, and have worked with service mesh technologies such as Envoy and Istio.

In terms of databases, I have a rich background in AWS DynamoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I have utilized Docker for containerization, and have employed Kubernetes, including AWS EKS and AWS ECS Fargate container orchestration. 

My interest in Lacework stems from its commitment to innovation and forward-thinking methodologies. Your focus on **developer infrastructure and productivity** resonates with my professional ethos and makes me excited about the potential of contributing to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my extensive skills and experience align with your needs and can contribute to Lacework. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience to arrange a conversation.

Sincerely,
